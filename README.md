It begins by listing all files in the target directory, then iterates through each file, checking if its name contains any of the specified keywords. If a match is found, the file is deleted using os.remove(), and its name is added to the deleted_files list. 

3. The function concludes by returning the **list of deleted files**. 

4. In the event of an error during the deletion process, **an exception is caught**, and an error message is printed, ensuring graceful error handling.
